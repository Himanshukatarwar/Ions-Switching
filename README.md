<h2>Dataset</h2>
  Features:-
    <p>1.Time  :-It is  a discrete batches of 50 seconds long 10 kHz samples (500,000 rows per batch). In other words, the data from 0.0001 - 50.0000 is a different batch than      50.0001 - 100.0000<br>
    2.Signal :-Electrical signal .<br>
    3.Number of channel:- Number of channel open at particular time.There are 0 to 10 channels that can open at any particular time.</p>
<h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>
  <p>1.MacroF1<br>
  2.Confusion Matrix.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
  1.First step is always try to clean the data and do some analysis.<br>
  2.There is added drift in signal,it needs to be removed.<br>
  3.Try Some featurization technique.<br>
  4.Use some standard ML MODEL.<br>
  5.Deep Learning model also tried.<br>
  6.Analysis the result.</p>
<h2>Result on Kaggle!</h2>
